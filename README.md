### Darknet WSL installer (WIP)

This script was made out of pure frustration, hopefully it works.

WARNING: There's a good chance this will break your install. Do be warned.

Installs darknet and opencv to use with a clean miniconda on a clean Ubuntu 20.04 WSL installation

Simply run:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Christophe-Foyer/install_scripts/main/Darknet_WSL_CUDA.sh
chmod +x Darknet_WSL_CUDA.sh
./Darknet_WSL_CUDA.sh
```

Then follow prompts. Make sure to initialize miniconda

Days of my life went into this and I will never get them back. I was tired of typing variations of commands so I've now strealined bug-squashing.

Pray for no cuda errors.
